## FOLIO

## How did I create this?

1. UI/UX is brainstormed using inspiration from winning portfolios from awwwards. High-fidelity mockup aggregating the ideas using Figma.
2. This project uses React for simplicity to break down sections as components. Also uses next.js to achieve SSG. SVGs have been animated using CSS.
3. Section scrolling and reveal animations uses GSAP. Card interactions use Tilt js. The timeline section was built using JS/SVGs and animated via GSAP.
4. Optimised animations, layer management, repaints, and re-layouts using Chrome dev tools.
